# parasite

**JAM Project**

**The project**

This project was a jam project.

I have to make this project in two weeks. i used this project to learn C++ and the SDL.
The theme of the jam was _parasite_. On this thene i imagined a pacman who must eat all parasite in an area.
The ghost was changed into virus.
